# Poker Reinforcement Learning Project

Can reinforcement learning tackle a problem as hard as Texas Holdem? This is a game with an extremely enormous state-space as well as players do not have all the information at their disposal. For this reason, I will try to implement some of Open Ai's Spinning Up algorithms to see if some basic approaches can be taken to do well in the game.

## Run GUI with 
> pypokergui serve ./poker_conf.yaml --port 8000 --speed moderate

## Run in terminal with 
> python main.py
